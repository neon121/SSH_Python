        <ul>
            <li>
                1. Main login window. Here you can add host
                if no port specified, 22 port will be used), SSH username and port, and choise Duo Security 2nd factor
                If "Phone passcodes" specified, and additional input string for answer will be displayed after 1th factor
                auth.<br/>
                Statuses are shown in right top corner
                Daemon status: shows if there is connection with php daemon.php over Websocket or no. Site looks for WS
                connection or ./daemon.php address.<br/>
                WS and WSS are supported. WSS need certificates to be available for read and write, see in daemon.php<br/>
                SSH status: if daemon.php has SSH connection opened (with both 2 factors passed), SSH status "connected"
                will be shown. Daemon doesn`t close SSH connection automaticaly,
                soo it typically survive between page reloads<br/>
                Log displayed in the bottom. It can contain important information about errors
            </li>
            <li>
                2. Options. Contains list of interpreters, directory that will be searched for files and file list.<br/>
                All data in unput (dashed strings) can be edited<br/>
                To add new interpreter, type its name in the last line. Can be passed as "python" or by full path (for ex.
                "/usr/lib/python")<br/>
                Red "X" is for delete item.<br/>
                Files can be uploaded (by dragging or choosing over standart file input),
                deleted (by red "X") or renamed. "V" symbol allows to see file content.<br/>
                IMPORTANT! Daemon gets file list from remote server over SSH connection, so if there is no SSH connection
                (SSH: no connected), daemon can't show file list, delete or rename.
            </li>
            <li>
                3. Commands. Every command consists from 3 parts: interpreter, arguments, target file.
                Changing/deleting/adding of items in 2nd part reflects on same value here. <br/>
                You can run only 1 command at the time<br/>
                For adding new commands edit the empty bottom line.<br/>
                You can run command by pressing button. When daemon processing a command, you will see elapsed time and
                link for immediate stop<br/>
                After command stops (by manual stop or after normal exit) you can see it's output<br/>
                IMPORTANT! Like file list in 2nd block, here is same situation: until daemon is disconnected from SSH
                server, all file selects are empty. All values will be loaded after SSH is connected.<br/>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Daemon.php can understand if duo auth failed, or failed back. If it failed back, you still can work with
            commands without any restrictions. If you failed once, you have to relogin again.<br/>
            Most of fields will be saved after changing (except login info, witch will be saved after pressing connection
            button)
        </p>
        <p>
            All commands and interpreters data will be saved between page reloads and daemon.php reruns, if daemon can
            make save file. If it can`t, log will contain an error message about it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Daemon.php needs to be run in the background. Command line for it: "php daemon.php start -d"<br/>
            If you need to change something, look in it's top for some control constants<br/>
            PHP version 7.0 is required.
